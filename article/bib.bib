abstract = {In transporter associated with antigen-processing (TAP)-deficient patients affected by a severe downmodulation of human leucocyte antigen class I (HLA-I) molecules, natural killer (NK) cells have an increased expression of the inhibitory receptor CD94/NKG2A. Focusing our attention on NK cells, we have investigated the phenotype, function and proliferative response of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBLs) derived from healthy donors after coculturing with TAP (T2)- or HLA-I-deficient (721.221) cell lines and their related HLA-I-expressing transfectants (T3 and DT360, respectively). After 4 days, NK cells cocultured with T2 cells had a threefold increased CD94 expression compared to NK cells cocultured with T3. This increase was due to proliferation of the CD56brightCD94bright subset. In contrast, expression of other inhibitory receptors [killer cell immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptors] was variable during time and was not related to HLA-I molecules expressed by stimulating cells. Similar results were obtained using HLA-I-deficient cells (721.221). The PBLs cocultured for 4 days with T2 cells displayed enhanced cytotoxic responses. The results suggest that CD56brightCD94bright NK cells are induced to proliferate and kill in response to a TAP-deficient environment. The changes seen in the NK-cell compartment were partially contributed by T lymphocytes present in the coculture. These data could explain the increased CD94 expression and autoimmune manifestations observed in TAP-deficient patients.},

@article{Sunderhauf2012,
abstract = {Current state of the art solutions of the SLAM problem are based on efficient sparse optimization techniques and represent the problem as probabilistic constraint graphs. For example in pose graphs the nodes represent poses and the edges between them express spatial information (e.g. obtained from odometry) and information on loop closures. The task of constructing the graph is delegated to a front-end that has access to the available sensor information. The optimizer, the so called back-end of the system, relies heavily on the topological correctness of the graph structure and is not robust against misplaced constraint edges. Especially edges representing false positive loop closures will lead to the divergence of current solvers. We propose a novel formulation that allows the back-end to change parts of the topological structure of the graph during the optimization process. The back-end can thereby discard loop closures and converge towards correct solutions even in the presence of false positive loop closures. This largely increases the overall robustness of the SLAM system and closes a gap between the sensor-driven front-end and the back-end optimizers. We demonstrate the approach and present results both on large scale synthetic and real-world datasets.},

@article{Grisetti2010,
abstract = {—Being able to build a map of the environment and to simultaneously localize within this map is an essential skill for mobile robots navigating in unknown environments in absence of external referencing systems such as GPS. This so-called simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem has been one of the most popular research topics in mobile robotics for the last two decades and efficient approaches for solving this task have been proposed. One intuitive way of formulating SLAM is to use a graph whose nodes correspond to the poses of the robot at different points in time and whose edges represent constraints between the poses. The latter are obtained from observations of the environment or from movement actions carried out by the robot. Once such a graph is constructed, the map can be computed by finding the spatial configuration of the nodes that is mostly consistent with the measurements modeled by the edges. In this paper, we provide an introductory description to the graph-based SLAM problem. Furthermore, we discuss a state-of-the-art solution that is based on least-squares error minimization and exploits the structure of the SLAM problems during optimization. The goal of this tutorial is to enable the reader to implement the proposed methods from scratch.},

The algorithms were run using the same type of robot on Player/Stage environment. The results show that the UKF-based FastSLAM has the best performance in terms of accuracy of localization and mapping.

The SLAM community has made astonishing progress over the last 30 years, enabling large-scale real-world applications, and witnessing a steady transition of this technology to industry. We survey the current state of SLAM and consider future directions. We start by presenting what is now the de-facto standard formulation for SLAM. We then review related work, covering a broad set of topics including robustness and scalability in long-term mapping, metric and semantic representations for mapping, theoretical performance guarantees, active SLAM and exploration, and other new frontiers. This paper simultaneously serves as a position paper and tutorial to those who are users of SLAM. By looking at the published research with a critical eye, we delineate open challenges and new research issues, that still deserve careful scientific investigation. The paper also contains the authors' take on two questions that often animate discussions during robotics conferences: Do robots need SLAM? and Is SLAM solved?},

abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of creating an objective benchmark for comparing SLAM approaches. We propose a framework for analyzing the results of SLAM approaches based on a metric for measuring the error of the corrected trajectory. The metric uses only relative relations between poses and does not rely on a global reference frame. The idea is related to graph-based SLAM approaches, namely to consider the energy that is needed to deform the trajectory estimated by a SLAM approach into the ground truth trajectory. Our method enables us to compare SLAM approaches that use different estimation techniques or different sensor modalities since all computations are made based on the corrected trajectory of the robot. We provide sets of relative relations needed to compute our metric for an extensive set of datasets frequently used in the SLAM community. The relations have been obtained by manually matching laser-range observations to avoid the errors caused by matching algorithms. Our benchmark framework allows the user an easy analysis and objective comparisons between different SLAM approaches.},
